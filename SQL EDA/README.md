## Chapter 1 - Basic SQL commands
   * Lesson 1.1 - Introduction and motivation for SQL
     * Learning objective: Introduce databases, including table definitions and field types, as well as prime students' environments for SQL development.
   * Lesson 1.2 - CREATE and INSERT statements
     * Learning objective: Create database tables in SQL, and import raw data from outside source, e.g. comma delimited.
   * Lesson 1.3 - SELECT, UPDATE and DELETE statements
     * Learning objective: Review methods for Viewing data with filters and formatting, as well as update table columns or removing rows.
## Chapter 2 - Reforming Tables for Analysis
   * Lesson 2.1 - Relational to Flat structure
     * Learning objective: Review SQL manipulation and table joining to attach master file information to transactional data to prepare data for Machine Learning.
   * Lesson 2.2 - Achieving Data Consistency
     * Learning objective: Learn methods of converting inconsistent string data into uniform values or numeric fields useful for machine learning.
   * Lesson 2.3 - Time series and Seasonality
     * Learning objective: Learn methods of decomposing date and time fields to extract regularity and seasonality of trends in the data.
## Chapter 3 - Missing Data
   * Lesson 3.1 - Statistical calculations
     * Learning objective: Extract meaningful statistics from data, such as mean, variance, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, etc.

     * Learning objective: Learn methods for extracting summary information from tables using GROUP BY and HAVING clauses.
   * Lesson 3.3 - Adding and Removing missing data
     * Learning objective: Elminate missing data using various options, including zeroing, global mean, inferred/local mean, and removing records with missing data.
## Chapter 4 - Popular Transformations
   * Lesson 4.1 - Categorical to 1-hot Encoding
     * Learning objective: Investigate conversion of categorical data to one-hot encoded data, and numerical data to binned data types.
   * Lesson 4.2 - Numeric transformations
     * Learning objective: Discuss preparation of numerical data for machine learning, including scaling and converting to log version.
   * Lesson 4.3 - Location based meta-data
     * Learning objective: Add meaning to geospacial tagging by calculating proximity to points of interest.
